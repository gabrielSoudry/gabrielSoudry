Hi üëã, I'm Gabriel, a software enginneer living near Paris, specialized in **Software architecture**, **Clood** and **Embedded Systems (IOT)**.

I've been working on **ROS**   (robot operating system) for 2 years now.

I like:
- Linux, Git and Docker  ‚öôÔ∏è
- Devops technologies, learning new technologies to automate tests, deploy, scale, build ‚ò∏Ô∏è
- IOT Devices, build robot from scratch from electronics to coding (Big fan of ROS)
- interesting projects: I choose carefully, to keep learning
