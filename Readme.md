Hi 👋, I'm Gabriel, a software enginneer living near Paris, specialized in **Software architecture**, **Clood** and **Embedded Systems (IOT)**.

I have studied Computer Science for 4 years with [the ESILV school](https://www.esilv.fr/en/), in a dual degree in Management and Marketing with [the EMLV school.  💼](https://www.emlv.fr/en/)
In late 2020 I'll be starting my last year in a Masters Degree in computer system architecture  with [Centrale SUPELEC]([https://www.centralesupelec.fr/](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/))  

I've been working on **ROS**  (robot operating system) for 2 years.

I like:
- Linux, Git and Docker  ⚙️
- Devops technologies, learning new technologies to automate tests, deploy, scale, build ☸️
- IOT Devices, build robot from scratch from electronics to coding (Big fan of ROS)
- interesting projects: I choose carefully, to keep learning
